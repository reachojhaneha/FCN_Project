Running instruction

python distributedMatrix.py num_worker work_split loss delay infile1 infile2 output_file

python distributedPi.py num_worker work_split loss delay num_iteration

Running these commands initiate the network topology, and starts the distribution and computation. Matrix multiplication will generate a output file for the result matrix, and pi calculation will return value of pi in std.
